# Python

This directory contains a python web-server that can be used to host the visualization tool. This server both serves the webpages to load the tool, and provides a rest-api that can be used for communication between the visualization tool and a BDD library.

We write this in python because most developers will have python installed on their computer already, regardless of what BDD library and other programming languages they use. Besides this, python does not have to be compiled and is quite consistent across different platforms.
